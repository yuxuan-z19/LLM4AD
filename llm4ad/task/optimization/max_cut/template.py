task_description = "Given an undirected weighted graph, you need to find a maximum cut (Max-Cut), \
which partitions all nodes into two sets S and T such that the total weight of edges between S and T is maximized. \
The task is solved by iteratively flipping nodes between S and T using local search. \
In each step, given a set of candidate nodes that can improve the cut, help me design a novel algorithm \
that selects the best node to flip, different from classic strategies like choosing the node with the highest gain."
